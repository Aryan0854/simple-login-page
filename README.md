**Login Page HTML/CSS README**

This repository contains code for a simple login page designed using HTML and CSS. The login page features a clean and modern design, with a background image and form elements for username and password input.

### File Structure:

- **index.html**: This file contains the HTML structure of the login page.
- **style.css**: This file contains the CSS styles to design the layout and appearance of the login page.
- **background-image.jpg**: This is the background image used for the login page. Replace it with your desired background image if needed.
- **login.php**: This file is the action target for the login form. You can handle the form submission and authentication logic in this file.

### Usage:

1. **HTML Structure**: Modify the HTML structure in `index.html` to suit your application's requirements. You can add additional form fields or customize the layout as needed.

2. **CSS Styling**: Customize the styles in `style.css` to match your branding or design preferences. You can adjust colors, fonts, and layout properties to achieve the desired look and feel.

3. **Background Image**: Replace `background-image.jpg` with your preferred background image. Ensure that the image is appropriately sized and optimized for web use.

4. **Form Action**: Update the `action` attribute of the `<form>` element in `index.html` to point to the appropriate backend script for handling form submissions (`login.php` in this case).

### Additional Notes:

- **Responsive Design**: The login page is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. However, further testing and adjustments may be needed based on specific device requirements.

- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the login page is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Follow best practices for semantic HTML markup and provide alternative text for images where necessary.

- **Security**: Implement proper security measures, such as encryption for transmitting sensitive data (e.g., passwords), and validation on the server-side to prevent unauthorized access.
